This is a showcase of an electronic red light, green light game from the popular series "Squid Game". It was created as a final project for a course named "Sensors and Actuators".
It utilizes an Arduino to control various sensors and peripherals (LEDs, motion sensors, a display, a buzzer, servos). 

The game is played as follows:
1. Place a player piece at one end of the board
2. Execute the code. The game is now running.
3. If the Green LED is lit, the player piece may be moved up the board.
4. If the red LED is on, you may not move the player.
5. If the player reaches the end of the board, you win!
6. If the player gets caught, a stick attached to a servo knocks the player off the board. you lose!
